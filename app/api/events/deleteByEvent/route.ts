// This function deletes all events associated with a specific eventId and client email.
// It connects to the database, checks for the required parameters, and performs the deletion.
// If successful, it returns the count of deleted events; otherwise, it returns an error message.
// This is useful for cleaning up events when an event is deleted or modified.
// Make sure to handle this API route in your client-side code to call it when needed.
